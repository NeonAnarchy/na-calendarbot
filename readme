This is the automated calendarbot of /r/NeonAnarchy.  It's a significantly modified version of the bot performing the
same function for /r/RunnerHub. (Full credit to /u/Ucuri from post: https://www.reddit.com/r/RunnerHub/comments/2qt9yv/calendar_bot_v2/)

This bot picks up job postings and adds them to this google calendar:

https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=dWRkajl2ZXNpdGozaWd2bGgzNmprcWQ0azhAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ

This is the format for the nacalendarbot.cfg file, that handles authentication with the google and reddit APIs.
You can configure the necessary id's and keys for google under https://console.developers.google.com/apis/. 
You also need a credentials.json and token.json for google.  The code will create these for you first time through,
but you will need a browser to successfully sign onto google before it creates them.
