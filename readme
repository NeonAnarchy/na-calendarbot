This is the automated calendarbot of /r/NeonAnarchy.  It's a significantly modified version of the bot performing the
same function for /r/RunnerHub. (Full credit to /u/Ucuri from post: https://www.reddit.com/r/RunnerHub/comments/2qt9yv/calendar_bot_v2/)

This bot picks up job postings from reddit's /r/NeonAnarchy and adds them to this Google calendar:

https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=dWRkajl2ZXNpdGozaWd2bGgzNmprcWQ0azhAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ

Running the bot:

To run the bot, you will need a nacalendarbot.cfg file, that configures authentication with the google and reddit APIs.
Two other files (credentials.json and token.json) are also required for the bot to run, but will be created first time
through.  (See build notes below.)

Create an empty nacalendarbot.cfg file, cutting/pasting in the following items.  Modify as required.

---[ cut/paste ]---
[Common]
subreddit = NeonAnarchy

[Google]
calendar_id =
calendar_public_url =
calendar_docs_url =
creator = NeonAnarchyCalendarBot

[Reddit]
client_id =
client_secret =
username =
password =
user_agent = /r/NeonAnarchy JobCalendarBot (by /u/NAnarchyCalendarBot)
---[ end cut/paste ]---

To run the project in your development environment:

1) Ensure you have python 3.8.6+ installed.  This bot has been also been tested on python 3.9.6.
    a) You will need to import referenced modules using pip.  I'm not including instructions for that here.
2) Sign into reddit using the account under which the bot will run. (eg. NAnarchyCalendarBot)
    a) Configure the [Reddit] username and password with this account information.
3) Follow the instructions here (https://www.pythonforengineers.com/build-a-reddit-bot-part-1/) to setup a reddit app;
    a) This will give you the [Reddit] client_id and client_secret values;
4) Sign into the google that owns the calendar (eg. nacalendarbot@gmail.com).
5) Follow the instructions here (https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/guides/auth) to create OAuth 2.0 Client
IDs (credentials).
    a) This process will provide the content for the credentials.json file required.
6) Go to the google calendar that you want to manipulate and grab the calendar_id value and the calendar_public_url
values.
    a) calendar_id is of the form: _blah_@group.calendar.google.com
    b) calendar_public_url is of the form: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=uddj9vesitj3igvlh36jkqd4k8%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Etc%2FGMT
        i) Remember to escape all '%' characters in the URL - make '%%'
7) Update the [Common]/[subreddit] value to the reddit you want the bot to scan.  (eg. NeonAnarchy or NeonRed)
8) Update the calendar_docs_url to wherever you keep your bot docs.  This value is embedded in each bot notification post.

Once done - you will have everything ready-to-go!

From there, start by running the unit tests (nacalendarbot_test.py) which will, first-time-through, authorise your
bot with google and will create the required token.json and credentials.json files in your working directory.  This
process will spawn a browser to do the oauth2 authorisation step, so I recommend doing it on a developer workstation and
copying those files over to your host afterwards.

Invoking the bot itself is just a matter of running the nacalendarbot.py script.  I do this in my own environment via
the scheduler on my synology NAS using the following script:

---[ cut/paste ]---
#!/bin/bash

# Change working directory to scripts folder (token/creds handling)
cd /var/services/homes/calendarbot/scripts

# Dump timestamp into logs as a marker
echo calendarbot ran at  `date` >> /var/services/homes/calendarbot/logs/calendarbot.log

# Go!
/usr/local/bin/python3 /var/services/homes/calendarbot/scripts/nacalendarbot.py >> /var/services/homes/calendarbot/logs/calendarbot.log 2>&1 &
---[ end cut/paste ]---

Enjoy!
